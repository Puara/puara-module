# Compiling

This chapter will guide you through the process of compiling the `puara-module` library and its examples.

## Arduino IDE

1.  Download the `puara-module` library as a ZIP file from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/sat-mtl/puara-module).
2.  In the Arduino IDE, go to `Sketch > Include Library > Add .ZIP Library...` and select the downloaded ZIP file.
3.  The examples will be available in `File > Examples > puara-module`.

## PlatformIO

1.  Clone the `puara-module` repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sat-mtl/puara-module.git
    ```
2.  Open the `puara-module` folder in Visual Studio Code with the PlatformIO extension installed.
3.  The examples are located in the `examples/` directory. You can open one of the examples and upload it to your ESP32 board.
